This is my first full stack web project. In this app you can create, read, update and delete companies, projects and tasks. You can see how much time each user worked on a specific task and a report for each company.

Programming languages and technologies:
* HTML
* CSS
* JS
* PHP
* Laravel
* AJAX
* Bootstrap
